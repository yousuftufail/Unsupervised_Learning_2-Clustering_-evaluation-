# Unsupervised_Learning_2-Clustering_-evaluation-

In this example I have worked on the grains data set containing the measurements (such as area, perimeter, 
length, and several others) (.csv file is in the folder). This file has six dimenssional however no. of clustering can be 6 or less than 6.
Therefore, first I have learned how to choose a good number of clusters for a dataset using the 
k-means inertia graph. Using this information cluster the grain samples into three clusters, and compare the clusters to 
the grain varieties using a cross-tabulation.

# Important modules for this example are:

1. pandas
2. seaborn
3. KMeans from sklearn.cluster
4. matplotlib.pyplot
